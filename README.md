## Summary & Background  
I'm building this app because I want to know facts about U.S. politics. I think there's an opportunity to have unbiased, factual reporting about Presidential and Congresional actions through the utilization of LLMs. 
I want to create an app that ingests all federal orders and produces social media posts and generates content for an email newsletter. Eventually, I'd love to make this a searchable tool that has all federal orders in a vector DB
and utilize RAG to have a knowledge assistant for federal documents.

## Progression
